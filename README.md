## Purpose and Scope

This document provides an overview of the Carbon Offset Marketplace, a blockchain-based system built on the Stacks blockchain that enables the trading of carbon credits as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The system allows companies and individuals to purchase, sell, and retire carbon credits representing metric tons of COâ‚‚ reduced or removed from the atmosphere.

This overview covers the high-level system architecture, core contracts, and carbon credit lifecycle.

## System Architecture

The Carbon Offset Marketplace consists of five interconnected Clarity smart contracts that manage the complete lifecycle of carbon credits from minting through retirement.
